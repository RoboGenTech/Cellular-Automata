#  2 dimensional Cellulla Automata - Jupyter Notebook
Visualization of 3 generations on a square grid by using mesh-grid coded with matplotlib and modifying properties of a scatterplot.
Using a python scipy.convolude2d library. New generation is a 'Convolude' with a rules signal to change state of neighbor cells.
# Functional and Object-oriented Programming -final Project
This final project produced a graphically interesting program (Conway’s Game of Life) using Java libraries. This project-based course introduced the foop paradigms including concepts such as functions, conditionals, data abstraction, recursion, lambda, higher-order functions, lists, loops, arrays, interfaces, inheritance, and polymorphism. The elements for Conway’s Game of Life included: 
- two-dimensional matrix of cells with possible states of 0 (meaning dead) and 1 (meaning alive)
- neighbor is an adjacent cell, and so a neighborhood is nine cells
