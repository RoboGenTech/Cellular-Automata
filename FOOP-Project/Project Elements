Functional and Object-oriented Programming -final Project

This project-based course introduced the foop paradigms including concepts such as functions, conditionals, data abstraction, recursion, lambda, higher-order functions, lists, loops, arrays, interfaces, inheritance, and polymorphism. 
This final project produced a graphically interesting program (Conway’s Game of Life) using Java libraries.

The elements for Conway’s Game of Life include-

- two-dimensional matrix of cells with possible states of 0 (meaning dead) and 1 (meaning alive)
- neighbor is an adjacent cell, and so a neighborhood is nine cells
