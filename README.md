# Cellular-Automata
  - John von Neumann: The Father of the Modern Computer is attributed to developing the cellular automata systems.
  - Illustrates the properties of complex systems at work.  
  - In two of my CS courses, I Investigated the program code for Cellular Automata

# 2d Cellular Autoata : 
 I learned Conway's GameOfLife in the introductory Computer Science class called FOOP
 Java with Swing program code exercises provided a good opportunity to practice skills with arrays, and object orientation in Java.
 However here, I am publishing a jupyter notebook demonstrating the convolude2d scipy library to show the siplified 2d cellular automata.
  
# One dimensional cellular automaton: 
 simulate cellular automaton in C++
