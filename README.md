# Cellular-Automata
the code implementation for the most famous CA cellular automaton: called the ‘GameOfLife’ created by Conway.

The facts that make the choice for this project  as interesting :

  - Illustrates the properties of complex systems at work. 
  - John von Neumann: The Father of the Modern Computer is attributed to developing the cellular automata systems. 
  - I investigated the program code (Implementation 1 in Java, and Implementation 2 in C++) for grades in two of my CS courses.

# Implementation 1: 
 2-D cellular automata to provide a good opportunity to practice skills with arrays, and object orientation in Java
# Implementation 2: 
 simulate just one—a cellular automaton in C++
